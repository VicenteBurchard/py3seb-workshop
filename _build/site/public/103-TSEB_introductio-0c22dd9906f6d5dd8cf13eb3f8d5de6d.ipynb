    "## Net longwave radiation\n",
    "The net longwave radiation a priori is much simpler as we assume that all emitted and indident longwave radiation is diffuse. In pyTSEB we follow a similar approach as the one described in [Kustas and Norman (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1923(99)00005-2) for partially vegetated surfaces, which also partitions net longwave radiation into the soil ($L_{n,S}$) and the canopy components ($L_{n,C}$). The only difference between pyTSEB and the formulation of [Kustas and Norman (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1923(99)00005-2) is that we incorporate longwave scattering between the soil and the canopy:\n",

[](#eq-kd), $\\epsilon_S$ is soil emisivity and $\\epsilon_C$ can be derived from Eq. [](#eq-rho-dir) ($\\epsilon_C = 1 - \\rho_{C,DIF,l}$) and leaf emissivity.\n",

    "## Sensible heat flux\n",
    "The key in TSEB models is the partition of sensible heat flux into the soil and canopy layers, which depends on the soil and canopy temperatures ($T_S$ and $T_C$ respectively, left side of Fig. [](#tseb)). Given the difficulty of obtaining the pure component temperatures, even with very high resolution data due to canopy gaps,[Norman et al (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-1923(95)02265-Y) found a solution to retrieve $T_S$ and $T_C$ using a single observation of the directional radiometric temperature $T_{rad}\\left(\\theta\\right)$ as this is the case for most of the remote sensing systems. Eq. [](#eq-TSEB_Trad) decomposes the composite $T_{rad}\\left(\\theta\\right)$ temperature between its components $T_S$ and $T_C$, assuming blackbody emission of thermal radiance:\n",

    ":::\n",
    "where $f_c\\left(\\phi\\right)$ is the fraction of vegetation observed by the sensor. Since [](#eq-TSEB_Trad) consists of two unknowns and only one equation, an iterative process to find $H_S$, $T_S$, $H_C$ and $T_C$ is defined based upon an initial guess of potential canopy transpiration, and under the assumption that during daytime hours condensation for the soil/substrate should not occur. The initial canopy latent and sensible heat fluxes are estimated based on the [Priestley and Taylor (1972)](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1972)100<0081:OTAOSH>2.3.CO;2) formulation for potential transpiration (Eq.

    "    \n",
    "With a first estimate of $T_{C}$, soil temperature is computed from Eq. [](#eq-TSEB_Trad) and then soil sensible and latent heat fluxes. At this stage, if soil latent heat flux results to be non-negative, a solution is found, otherwise the Priestley-Taylor coefficient is reduced incrementally , reducing hence the canopy transpiration, in order to avoid negative soil latent heat flux, until a realistic solution is found (no condensation occurring neither in the soil nor in the canopy in daytime). \n",
