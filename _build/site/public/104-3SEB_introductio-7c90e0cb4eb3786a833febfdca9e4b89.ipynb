    "\n",
    "The 3SEB model ([**Burchard-Levine et al. 2022**](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16002)) is an adapted version of the TSEB model [**Norman et al. (1995)**](https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-1923(95)02265-Y), where an additional vegetation source is incorporated into TSEB to better characterize agro-ecosystems with multiple vegetation layers that have distinct structural and physiological features. This adaptation was initially envisioned for savanna-like ecosystems which are characterized by the co-existence of trees and herbaceous species with very different structural and phenological dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the 3SEB model structure is also well adapted for perennial tree crops that have cover crops in the interrow, such as vineyards, olive orchards, almonds etc. In principle, the 3SEB model is more suited to represent the complex interactions between a clumped vegetation source planted in rows with an additional herbaceous vegetation source located in the interrows. \n",

    "* 3SEB presents the advantage of partitioning fluxes from two distict coexisting canopies, one sparse overstory and another rather horizontally homogenous understory.\n",
    "* As compared to TSEB, it requires basically the same inputs plus an estimate of LAI separation between the overstory and the understory. With some knowledge of phenology of both layers, it is doable to make such separation\n",
    "* The improvement of 3SEB over TSEB is only evident when both layers are coexisting and actively transpiring. Otherwise TSEB could be used instead due to its greater simplicity.\n",
