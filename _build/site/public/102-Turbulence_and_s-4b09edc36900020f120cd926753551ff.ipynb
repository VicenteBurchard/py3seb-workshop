    "# About the surface temperature\n",
    "We already mentioned that the aerodynamic temperature ($T_0$), which is the temperature that holds valid the sensible heat flux equation, is different to the radiometric surface temperature (LST) estimated with Earth observation remote sensing. It is therefore important to be aware of such difference and to be able to correctly interpret LST when estimating sensible heat flux and/or ET.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    ":class:dropdown\n",
    "Indeed, the different remote sensing ET models mainly differ on how they use the LST in order to retrieve $H$ and/or $\\lambda E$.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, since heat is exchanged less efficiently than momentum, we need to correctly define the aerodynamic roughness length for heat transport ($z_0H$), and, indeed, the relationship $z_{0H} \\approx 0.1 z_{0M}$ might not be valid for all types of surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the radiometric surface temperature can significantly change depending on the observation viewing angle. This is particularly relevant for Earth observation sensors with a wide field of view or wide swath, such as Sentinel-3 SLSTR, with view zenith angles ranging from nadir ($VZA = 0$º) up to VZAs of 50º or 60º. This is important since the sensor might see a different proportion of (cool) vegetation and (warm) soil. Indeed, we saw in the previous exercise that the canopy transmittance depends on the canopy density, the leaf angle distribution, and the incidence/illumination angle. This effect is perfectly reciprocal when we deal with the sensor geometry instead of the solar geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive plot below demonstrates this effect. You can define the sensor's view zenith angle as well as the dominant leaf inclination angle. According to the soil and canopy temperatures estimated in the [previous simulation](#ET-simulations), and after setting as well the soil and leaf emissivity, the graph will display the estimated LST for a range of LAIs.\n",
