The latter is usually defined as the Leaf Area Index (LAI): half of the total leaf surface per unit ground. The larger the LAI, the more likely that the sun beams will be intercepted by one or more leaves, and, thus less likely for solar beams to reach the ground. \n",

    "The solar elevation angle ($\\beta$ in the previous graph), or its complementary the solar zenith angle (SZA), also plays a relevant role.

Therefore, the Beer-Lambert law must be adapted to account for this effect. In the next graph, you will be able to experiment with this phenomenon. Try changing both the amount of leaves in terms of LAI and the dominant zenith orientation of leaves, i.e. from canopies with predominantly vertical (LIDF$\\approx$90º) leaves to predominantly horizontal (LIDF$\\approx$0º) leaves."

    "As we have previously mentioned, the albedo ($\\alpha$) is the key variable that determines the amount of intercepted light that is absorbed by the surface. $\\alpha$ is defined as the proportion of incident shortwave radiation that is reflected by the surface. The shortwave net radiation ($S_n$) is therefore the balance between the incident shortwave irradiance ($S^\\downarrow$) and the reflected shortwave radiance ($S^\\uparrow = \\alpha S^\\downarrow$)\n",

    "The spectral properties of the surface are key in determining the albedo. For instance, fresh snow shows large values ($\\alpha\\approx 0.9$) and, thus, reflects most of the solar irradiance, while oceans have much lower values ($\\alpha\\approx0.05$), absorbing a large amount of solar irradiance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaves, due to their photosynthetic activity, absorb a large proportion of light due to the presence of chlorophylls, as well as other leaf pigments. For that reason, leaves yield relative low albedo values ($\\approx0.15$). On the other hand, soils can have a large range of albedo values, depending on their mineral composition, texture and topsoil moisture. Therefore, the albedo of a vegetated surface will depend not only on leaf chlorophyll concentration but also on canopy density and, in a lesser degree, on the soil albedo in situations of sparse vegetation or initial growth stages.\n",

    "## Vegetation anisotropy\n",

The most extreme cases would be specular surfaces (such as mirrors, still water bodies or ice), which scatter most the irradiance in the opposite direction of the incidence angle. The opposite case would be lambertian surfaces, where apparent brightness/scattering is the same regardless the direction.\n",

    "* Finally, the surface emissivity, the values of which usually range from 0.95 in arid areas with scarce vegetation to 0.99 in dense vegetation surfaces, has a lesser effect in the calculation of net longwave radiation. Therefore, for computing of net radiation its retrieval does not require very high accuracy."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "In this exercise we have seen that net shortwave radiation depends mainly on:\n",
    "1. Shortwave irradiance, which can be obtained from meteorological stations or from numerical weather models (e.g. [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview \"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview\")).\n",
    "2. Surface albedo\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the surface albedo mainly depends on:\n",
    "1. Leaf and soil spectral properties, mainly leaf chlorophyll content as the main pigment absorber in the PAR region.\n",
    "2. Canopy structural characteristics, mainly LAI but also leaf angle distribution.\n",
    "3. In addition, for row crops, the row architecture may be crucial in characterizing the radiation partitioning between ground and canopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net longwave radiation has a lower contribution to the global net radiation ($R_n$), and its estimation is usually simpler, requiring:\n",
    "1. Incident longwave irradiance, which can be obtained from meteorological stations or from numerical weather models (e.g. [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview \"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview\")).\n",
    "2. Surface emissivity and temperature, both of which can be obtained from thermal infrared Earth Observation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These analyses will allow you to better understand the radiative part of the energy balance. In addition, these simulations will permit evaluating the cost/benefit of using simpler or more sophisticated models for estimating net radiation and its partitioning between soil and canopy in structurally complex canopies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next exercise, you will work on the other main factor of the energy balance that can be estimated with thermal infrared Earth Observation, the [sensible heat flux](./102-Turbulence_and_sensible_heat_flux.ipynb).\n",
